= Klump Configuration Reference =
*   __Enable/Disable__ - Check this checkbox to Enable "Pay with Klump" on your store's checkout page
*   __Title__ - This is what users will see on the checkout page. The default is "Pay in Instalments - Klump" but you can change this to better reflect how you communicate with your customers.
*   __Description__ - This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. You can change the default description to describe in your own words the benefit of Klump to your customers.
*   __Test Mode__ - Check this to enable test mode. Test mode requires test public and secret key and it allows you to see Klump in action before going live to start receiving real payments from your customers.
*   __API Keys__ - Klump requires public and private API keys for both test mode and live mode. You can obtain them from your Klump merchant dashboard.
*   __Webhook URL__ - To complete the order automatically, copy and paste the webhook link here on your Klump merchant dashboard.
*   __Enable Klump Ads__ - This shows your customers the breakdown of the payment stages if they want to use Klump before they start the process. It's nice to have but not required for Klump to work on your site.
*   __Disallow cancel order__ - Removes the cancel order button if enabled
*   __Autocomplete order__ - If enabled automatically resolves order from webhook call after payment. Note: It requires webhook to work for the most part.
*    Click on __Save Changes__ to update the settings.

= Troubleshooting =
If you do not find Klump on WooCommerce payments tab on settings page, please check and ensure the following:
